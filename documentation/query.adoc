= Learn basic Cypher in the Query tab of Neo4j Workspace

== Query Guide

This guide is the next step after you've completed _Get started_, _Data Importer_, and _Explore_.
You can follow this guide independently as well.

It gives you an introduction to Cypher fundamentals and presents some more complex queries.
You will learn your way around the Query UI so you can make the most of all it has to offer.

Just like the previous guides, the Query guide uses the Northwind dataset.
If you have completed the Data Importer guide, you already have the data needed and can just skip past the next step.
If you are doing this guide independently, you need to import the dataset to run your queries on.
Just follow the instructions in the next step and you will be set up in a minute.

== Load the Northwind dataset

Again, if you already have completed the Data Importer guide, you can skip this step.
If not, then first navigate to the _Data Importer_ tab:

button::Go to Data Importer[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=import]

Use the button to load and map the data:

button::Load the Northwind dataset[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind/main/import/northwind-data-importer-mode-data.zip]

Once that's all done, click _Run import_ in the top right corner.

If you want to learn more about importing data, try the Data Importer guide.

With the data imported, navigate back to the _Query_ tab and get started with learning Cypher:

button::Go back to Query[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=query]

== Get to know the database

A good place to start is to take stock of what you have in your database.
You access _Database Information_ from the very top of the sidebar.

There you'll see how many nodes you have and all their labels, the number of relationships and their types, and also a list of all the property keys present in the database.

A node can have multiple labels and the list shows _all_ labels in the database.

Relationships on the other hand, can have only one type, but multiple relationships can exist between the same nodes.

The list of property keys include both node properties and relationship properties.

You can click any of the labels, types, or property keys to run a query that returns a sample of nodes and/or relationships that has that label, type, or property.

For example, try click on the `Product` node label and you'll see this query populated and executed for you:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Product) RETURN n LIMIT 25;
----

== Anatomy of the Query result stream

Central to the Query UI is the shell-like Cypher editor and result frame.
These two components act as a rich and interactive _Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop_ for working with graph queries and results.

The main Cypher editor is located at the top and this is where you write, edit, and execute your queries.

When you execute, or _run_, a query from the editor, or when you run any auto-generated queries (such as clicking on node labels or example queries in this guide), this triggers the presentation of a result frame.

The result frame contains both the executed query as well as the results of it.
As you run more queries from the main editor, new result frames are generated, pushing the previous ones down.
The latest one is always at the top.

The result frames are reusable.
This means that you can edit the query within the frame and run it again without spawning a new result frame.

We'll have a closer look at the frame itself in the next step.

== Anatomy of a result frame

As mentioned before, the result fram consists of two parts, a Cypher editor and space to display the results of the Cypher query.
The frame has three primary views: graph, table, or RAW.

image::result-options.png[]

The default view is graph.
Run the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p=()-[:CONTAINS]->() RETURN p LIMIT 25;
----

The result is a neat graph of 25 relationships of the type `CONTAINS`, which links `Order` nodes to `Product` nodes.
On your right you can see the properties panel with information about the entities in your graph.
You can click on any of them to change their styling, i.e. color, size, and/or caption.
If you select any _one_ element in your graph, the properties panel will show only the contents of that element and allow you to change the styling of only that element.

If your query doesn't return any nodes, the result defaults to the table view and the graph view is not shown.
You can try this by clicking on one of your properties from the list in database information, `orderID` for example.
Using the tabular representation comes in handy when you want to compare items in the same return line and resembles SQL.

The RAW option shows the submitted query, the Neo4j server version and address, the result, and a summary.

== Use basic Cypher to answer questions

If you have already completed the Data Importer guide, you are familiar with the data model of the Northwind dataset, but if you haven't, you can see it in the _Import_ tab since you downloaded it in a previous step. 
Another way is to use this procedure:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization
----

Once you have an idea of the structure of the data, it's time to use Cypher to answer questions and solve problems.

Let's take a look at the different companies supplying Northwind with products and see which supplier provides products from which categories:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (s:Supplier)-->(:Product)-->(c:Category)
RETURN s.companyName as Company, collect(distinct c.categoryName) as Categories
----

This query finds _suppliers_ that _supply_ a _product_ which is part of a _category_ and returns the company names and the categories they supply products from, in a table.
In cases where the same supplier supplies products from more than one category, the categories are collected and listed together, as you can see in the _Categories_ column.
Note that even though you specified the _Product_ node in the `MATCH` part of the query, no information about the actualy product is returned since this is not included in the `RETURN` part.

Maybe you are interested only in suppliers of a certain category, say _Condiments_:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Category {categoryName:"Condiments"})<--(:Product)<--(s:Supplier)
RETURN DISTINCT s.companyName as CondimentsSuppliers
----

This query finds a category with the name _Condiments_ (one of the properties on the _Category_ node, if you recall the data model) and links that to a _Product_ and the product to a _Supplier_ that supplies it.
The query uses _variables_, `c` and `s`, for the category and the supplier, respectively, but _not_ for the product.
That's because the product happens to be on the path between the two types of nodes you are interested in, just like in the previous example.
Note that since you are only interested in that a relationship exist between these nodes and not in _what type_ of relationship, you don't have to specify any relationship type in the query.

This is fairly basic, so let's move on to something a little more complex.

== Write more advanced Cypher for problem-solving

With the basics out of the way, let's have a look a more complex problem.
Assume that you want to see which product categories are typically co-ordered with other product categories.
This might help you understand which products to promote alongside others, or finding gaps in opportunities to promote products often ordered together.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Order)-[:ORDERS]->(:Product)-[:PART_OF]->(c:Category) 
WITH o, collect(c.categoryName) as Categories WHERE size(Categories) > 1 
RETURN DISTINCT Categories
----
