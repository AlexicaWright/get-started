== Connect to the Database

Connect to a database by creating a `Driver` object and providing a URL and an authentication token.
Once you have a `Driver` instance, use the `.verify_connectivity()` method to ensure that a working connection can be established.

[source, python, copy=true]
----
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# URI examples: "neo4j://localhost", "neo4j+s://xxx.databases.neo4j.io"
URI = "{neo4j-database-uri}"
AUTH = ("<Username>", "<Password>")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    driver.verify_connectivity()
