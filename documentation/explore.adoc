= Explore and interact with the data visualization in Neo4j Workspace

== Explore guide - an introduction

The _Explore_ tab is a no-code interface that allows you to explore and interact with your graph data.
You can customize Saved Cypher to enable common workflows for both developer and non-developer users.

In order to use Explore, you need to have data in your database and therefore it's recommended that you take this guide _after_ the Data Importer guide.

However, if you already feel comfortable with importing and modeling data, you can use the button below to quickly load and import both data and model for the Northwind dataset.
To do this, first go to the _Import_ tab:

button::Go to Data Importer[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=import]

And then load and import:

button::Load the Northwind dataset[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind/main/import/northwind-data-importer-mode-data.zip]
